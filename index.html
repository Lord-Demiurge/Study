    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Breaks:</strong> Use breaks to recharge. Avoid screens during breaks to reduce eye strain.</li>
        <li><strong>Applied Communication Skills:</strong> Given less priority, this module is scheduled for shorter study blocks at the end of each day.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Adjust the plan based on your workload. For example, if you have more assignments for a specific module, allocate more time to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Ensure you get 7-8 hours of sleep each night. If this schedule feels too late, consider ending at 22:30 and starting earlier in the morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekends:</strong> Use Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays for revision, assignments, and relaxation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unbiased Opinion on the Timetable:</h2>
    <p>
        This timetable is well-structured and balances study time with breaks, which is essential for maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. Here are some key points to consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The inclusion of breaks helps prevent fatigue and keeps you productive.</li>
                <li>All six modules are covered, with Applied Communication Skills given less priority.</li>
                <li>The evening study sessions are focused and align with your modules, ensuring you cover all subjects.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying until 23:30 may be too late for some people, as it could interfere with sleep. Lack of sleep can negatively impact focus and productivity the next day.</li>
                <li>The study blocks are relatively short (1-1.5 hours), which may not be enough for deep work on complex topics. If you have heavy assignments, you might need longer blocks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider ending the study session earlier (e.g., 22:30) to ensure you get enough sleep.</li>
                <li>If you find the study blocks too short, extend them to 2 hours with a 10-minute break in the middle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Overall, this timetable is a good starting point, but it may require adjustments based on your workload, energy levels, and sleep needs. Listen to your body and adapt the plan as necessary.
